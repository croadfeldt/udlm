# UDLM file index — what each document owns

**Purpose.** One home per concept. This index says, for every normative document, *what it is* and *what it canonically owns* — so before you write a rule, vocabulary, or wire-shape, you can find the file that already owns it and **reference it** rather than restate it. This is the human-readable companion to the single-source rule (`registry/SPEC-DESIGN-REQUIREMENTS.md` §33) and its check (`tests/check_single_source.py`).

**How to use it.** Look up the concept you're about to write. If a file below already *owns* it, put your rule there (or reference its ID). If nothing owns it, the file whose purpose is the closest fit is the home — add it there and note the new ownership here. Never define the same rule in two files; cite the owning file's ID with a one-line gist — the reference carries its own gist (e.g. `ADR-008 — the UDLM/DCM boundary test`), never a bare pointer.

Rule-ID families (`INF-*`, `ENT-*`, `DPO-*`, …) each belong to exactly one file — the "Owns" line names them.

---

## Root

- **`README.md`** — project entry point and orientation. *Owns:* nothing normative; summarizes and links.
- **`CONFORMANCE.md`** — what wire-level conformance certifies (and does not), the declaration shape, levels, and the wire-compatibility checklist. *Owns:* conformance levels, the `.well-known` declaration, the required-contracts list (§5), the wire-compat checklist (§6).
- **`GLOSSARY.md`** — human-readable term definitions. *Owns:* short prose glosses only; the machine taxonomy lives in `registry/resource-types/taxonomy-term.json`.

## `foundations/` — the core model everything else builds on

- **`foundations.md`** — the three abstractions (Data · Provider · Policy). *Owns:* the abstraction triad.

## `docs/` and `docs/adr/`

- **`docs/adr/`** — Architecture Decision Records. A ratified ADR is the authority for the decision it records; spec prose conforms to it, never contradicts it (e.g. ADR-007 owns "profiles are composed sets, not levels"). Its README also indexes the **instance-backed `ADR-<FAMILY>-NNN` namespace** (`ADR-PROV/RBAC/COST/AEP-*`) — DecisionRecord JSON in `registry/instances/`, resolvable only through that index.
- **`docs/`** (root) — orientation + settled narrative surface: the file index, signoff procedure, consumer perspective, the 0.1 engineering handoff, **profiles.md** (the six profiles — personas/environments/differing characteristics), and the settled "what this settles" docs (dependency-modeling, foundational-resources, graph-integrity, host-network-and-config-model, profile-resolution). Non-normative unless a doc states otherwise.
- **`docs/design/`** — design rationale + decision trails (scoped-class hierarchy, registry design notes).
- **`docs/examples/`** — non-normative worked examples (VM end-to-end trace, the DAV knowledge case study, provider accreditation).
- **`docs/flows/`** — the flow tier (stage-level walkthroughs; see its README).
- **`docs/internal/`** — tracked working/review artifacts (review packages, decision-support artifacts such as the 0.1 ratification-readiness and conformance-suite plans, the data-point necessity audit); not part of the published spec surface.
- **`docs/research/`** — prior art, proposals, and vision explorations (architecture-as-code, LikeC4, OSAC, holistic vision).
